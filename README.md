# movie-rec-sys
The Movie Recommender System project utilizes 
Python (core programming language used), 
Pandas (data manipulation and analysis using DataFrame datastructure), 
Streamlit (to create the interactive user interface), 
Pickle (to load precomputed movie similarity matrices and movie metadata.), 
Requests (to make HTTP requests to the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. It fetches movie details and poster images) and 
TMDB API (movie posters)

Core algorithm uses a similarity matrix to find and rank movies based on their similarity to a given movie. This matrix is precomputed using techniques like cosine similarity on movie feature vectors.

pending deployment (options -  Streamlit Cloud , Heroku)
